### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I think I could split my own private world in two parts â€” sports and technology. Iâ€™m practicing martial arts and doing kettlebell trainings. Plus, I love motorsports (F1, FE). When it comes to the other part, Iâ€™m following technology news, learning a lot about A.I. and machine learning, and programming â€” both as a hobby and professionally. Thanks to Codetain I can develop my skills and interests among wonderful talented and passionate people! The diversity of our personalities and professional experience makes our meetings extra exciting and we always come up with unexpected but effective solutions for various problems!
